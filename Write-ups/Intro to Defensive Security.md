## Task 1 - Introduction to Defensive Security

**defensive security**  
    - preventing intrusions from occurring 
    - detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly 

defensive security tasks 
    - cybersecurity education, training users, awareness 
    - document and manage assets 
    - updating and patching systems 
    - set up preventative security devices (firewall and IPS)
    - set up logging and monitoring devices

## Task 2 - Areas of Defensive Security 

### Security Operations Center (SOC)

SOC monitors network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events 

main areas of interest for a SOC 
    - remediating vulnerabilities 
    - policy violations
    - unauthorized activity 
    - network intrusions 

**threat intelligence** 
    intelligence = info you gather about actual or potential enemies 
    threat = any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system 

gather info to help company prepare against adversaries 
    achieve a threat informed defense 

intelligence needs data 
    data can come from local sources in network logs 
    or public sources like forums 

### Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

digital forensics focuses on analyzing evidence of an attack and its perpetrators 

focus on different areas such as: 
    - file system 
        - installed programs, created files, partially overwritten files, and deleted files 
    - system memory 
        - if attacker is using fileless malware (in memory), taking a forensic image (low-level copy) of memory is best way to combat 
    - system logs 
    - network logs

### Incident Response 

1. Preparation 
2. Detection and Analysis 
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery 
4. Post-Incident Activity 

### Malware Analysis 

1. Static analysis - inspecting the malicious program without running it. Requires knowledge of assembly 
2. Dynamic analysis - running malware in controlled environment
