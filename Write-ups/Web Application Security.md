## Introduction

can think of a web app like a program that we use without installing 
    it is a program running on a remote server 

online shopping app 
    web app reads data about products from database
        info about products, customers, invoices 
    could have multiple databases 
        products db 
        customers db 
        sales db

searching for an item on an online shopping site 
    1. user enters item name and searches 
    2. web app queries products db for keyword 
    3. product db returns search results 
    4. web app formats results in user friendly way

many company offer bug bounty programs that offer rewards for anyone who discovers vulnerabilities within scope of program
